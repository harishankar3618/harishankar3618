# Hi there, I'm Hari Shankar! üëã

## üöÄ About Me


I'm a third-year Computer Science Engineering student specializing in Cybersecurity, with over two years of hands-on experience in ethical hacking and penetration testing. I wield security tools like Burp Suite, Metasploit, and Nmap like a cybersecurity ninja. Certified in Ethical Hacking and Kali Linux, I'm currently diving deep into Malware Analysis and Security Monitoring‚Äîbecause what‚Äôs life without a little digital chaos?

When I‚Äôm not poking at vulnerabilities, I‚Äôm probably convincing my friends that "password123" is not an acceptable security practice. üòÇüîê If you‚Äôve ever used "admin" as your password, I offer free cybersecurity interventions.

## üìà Projects

- **Antivirus Malware Scanner (In Progress):** Because relying on default antivirus software is like bringing a wooden sword to a cyber battle.
- **Phishing Mail Detector Browser Extension (In Progress):** Protecting users from clicking on "You've won $1,000,000!" emails.
- **RansomWatch.Online:** A signature-based malware scanner that snitches on malicious files.
- **Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool:** Because even ancient Romans needed cybersecurity.
- **Image Encryption Tool:** When hiding files in a folder labeled "Homework" isn't enough.
- **Password Strength Analyzer:** Spoiler: "iloveyou" is not a secure password.
- **Network Packet Monitoring Tool:** Because what‚Äôs happening on your network shouldn't be a mystery.
